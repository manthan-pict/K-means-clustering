# K-means-clustering
Implementation of k means clustering algorithm using two different initiation strategies.

In this assignment we have implemented k mean algorithm using two strategies-
Strategy 1 – 
  Choose the k (Number of clusters) initial clusters randomly from the input data samples.
 
Strategy 2 –
 Pick the first center randomly; for the i-th center (i>1), choose a sample (among all possible samples) such that the average distance of this chosen one to all previous (i-1) centers is maximal.
